					<h2>The Chosen One</h2>
					<div style="display: flex; width: 100%; height: auto;flex-direction: row;gap: 5px;">
						<p style="font-size: 22px;">Anakin was born in a very poor planet called Tatoone, but he wasn't
							alone,
							his mother was there, she was everything for him, but they were slaves, Anakin
							wanted to free everyone in the galaxy but he didn't know how. When he was 9 years old,
							he met two Jedi Knights called Qui Gon Jin and Obi Wan Kenobi, they were in a mission
							with the princess of Naboo (Padme Amidala), Qui Gon Jin believed that Anakin was the Chosen
							one, who will destroy the darkness in the galaxy and restore the peace, Qui Gon Jin thought
							that
							because Anakin didn't have father, he was conceived by the force. When Anakin met Those Jedi
							Knights,
							he wanted to be free and then become in a Jedi Knight in order to make the galaxy safer for
							everyone,
							he wasn't moved by the power, he was just a child that wanted to set free his mother and
							him. Anakin decided to be trained by Qui Gon to be a Jedi Knight and then go back to set
							free his mother.

					<div style="display: flex; width: 100%; height: auto;flex-direction: row-reverse;gap: 1.5rem;">
						<p style="font-size: 25px;text-align: left;">At the end of the first film, Qui Gon Jinn died, so
							Anakin wil be
							the Obi Wan apprentice,
							at the beginning, no one trusted Anakin because he was too old to be trained as a Jedi,
							no one believed he could be the chosen one, but he was a brilliant student and he became
							in the most powerful jedi in the order, his abilities were in a next level, however his
							emotions were a chaos, his mind was full of anger and regrets, his thoughts were with his
							mother, he came back but when he found her, she was dead by a gang thieves, he decided to
							kill all the thieves, although it was forbidden by the jedi order. Anakin felt in love
							with the senator Padme Amidala, she was like something more than a mother for Anakin, so
							he was determined to protect her from this dark and dangerous galaxy. But no one can know
							his marriage with her, otherwise he would be removed from his rank as Jedi Knight.

					<div

						<p style="font-size: 25px;text-align: left;">Three years later, Anakin had a vision about
							Padme's dead, he was terrified because
							he had a same vision about his mother before she died. Anakin wants to protect Padme
							but he didn't know how, everyone in the order have a bad feeling about him, his master
							is like a brother for him but he doesn't know how to talk about this feeling with him,
							so he decided to trust in the chancellor Palpatine, the leader of the galactic republic,
							but the chancellor is a Sith Lord (a dark force user against jedi), the chancellor listened
							Anakin doubts as the father he didn't have, the chancellor manipulated Anakin in order to
							turn him into the dark side with promises about how to save Padme's life.

						<p style="font-size: 25px;">By order of the chancellor, the jedis were declared as traitors,
							then Anakin killed many jedis,
							he wasn't a jedi anymore, he was corrupted and confused about his actions, at the end of the
							third film, he killed Padme and fought against his old master Obi Wan, he failed, Obi Wan
							almost
							killed him, he survived thanks to the chancellor, but his wounds were fatal, henceforth, he

							Vader
